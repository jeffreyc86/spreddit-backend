Part of it is that I don't have a stable source of income which means that I can't buy 'luxuries' like beauty products (thankfully I still live at home so I don't have to worry about rent or utilities), but part of it is just not being able to see the point in trying to be cute when there's nowhere to go. If I believed that restrictions were going to be lifted in a few months and I'd have a chance at a fun summer before I go back to campus in the fall, I would work out, take care of my skin, etc. But it doesn't seem like COVID restrictions are going to be over any time soon, even with so many people getting vaccinated, since we apparently have to keep our masks on and social distance even after we've gotten our vaccines. I've been excited for my cousin's wedding in July, but now I doubt it's even going to happen, so I can't bring myself to care about what I'll look like at it. I guess this is a form of low-grade depression, but I just feel so fat and disgusting and apathetic towards everything. Is anyone else going through the same?",
